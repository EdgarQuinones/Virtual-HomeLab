Services Learned:
  This is more of a personal document for noting important services and commands I have learned when working on my home lab.

- nmcli: Command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager
  - sudo con mod/up 'network' ipv4.addresses <IP> ipv4.method auto/manual 
    - Can manually configure your IP, or have your DHCP server auto setup. 

- Fail2Ban: Set of server and client programs to limit brute force authentication attempts

- Yum: Updator, similar to apt to update, upgrade, and install programs

- DHCP Server
  - I had 2 Network Intefaces, but I wanted to only to listen on 1, so I used this command.
    - First had to make a cp of the dhcpd file and edit the ExecStart line to add the interface I wanted to be listed on. 
      - sudo cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/dhcpd.service /etc/systemd/system/dhcpd.service
      - ExecStart=/usr/sbin/dhcpd -f -cf /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf -user dhcpd -group dhcpd --no-pid <Interface>
