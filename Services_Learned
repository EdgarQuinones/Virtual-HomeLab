Services Learned:
  This is more of a personal document for noting important services and commands I have learned when working on my home lab.

- nmcli: Command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager
  - sudo con mod/up 'network' ipv4.addresses <IP> ipv4.method auto/manual 
    - Can manually configure your IP, or have your DHCP server auto setup. 

- Fail2Ban: Set of server and client programs to limit brute force authentication attempts

- Yum: Updator, similar to apt to update, upgrade, and install programs
