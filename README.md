# Virtual HomeLab
I've always wanted to make a HomeLab, but finding and affording physical devices can be difficult. Until I get that opportunity, I am running a Virtual HomeLab by running multiple Virtual Machines on my Desktop and have created a LAN Network of servers communicating with each other. Below are the details of each machine and my plans for the future.

## Current Set Up
This lab consists of three primary virtual machines (VMs): CentOS, Debian, and Kali Linux, each tailored for specific roles within our network architecture. The CentOS VM acts as the central hub and router, providing both local network connectivity to the Debian and Kali VMs and managing external internet access via its NAT-configured network adapter. The Debian VM is set up for the development and testing of software projects, while the Kali Linux VM is dedicated to security testing and penetration exercises. This configuration allows for a versatile and isolated environment to experiment with network configurations, server setups, and security practices, all within the confines of a single host machine. Whether for educational purposes, personal development, or security testing, this virtual lab offers a comprehensive platform to advance my skills in system administration, networking, and cybersecurity.
